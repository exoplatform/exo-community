The upgrade procedure is only guaranteed and tested to be transparent from the previous maintenance version (x.y.z from x.y.z-1). So, we recommend to apply upgrade procedures for all versions between your current and the target one.
However, if you still insist on skipping versions, we strongly advise to read all upgrade notes of the versions you are skipping to see if your project is impacted by any previous upgrade procedure.

=== Troubleshooting ===

In a cluster environment, database locks issues can happen when starting the nodes the first time after the upgrade.
The best solution to fix this is to start and stop completely one of the nodes to do the upgrade, then start the cluster.

== Upgrading from Platform 4.3.1 to 5.3.0 ==

=== Description of the plugins used in this upgrade ===

#PLF-6737: No signature of method: static org.exoplatform.services.deployment.Utils.sanitize() when using the Announcement template

In addition, upgrade scripts are automatically run at startup in this version to migrate wiki and social data from JCR to JPA.
Wiki data migration is done synchronously, meaning that the eXo Platform instance will be available only once the data migration is done.
Social data migration is done asynchronously, meaning that the data migration will run after the eXo Platform start.

=== Architecture changes ===

Since the version 4.4.0, eXo Platform requires Elasticsearch.
eXo Platform is shipped with an embedded version of Elasticsearch which automatically starts when eXo Platform starts.
This embedded Elasticsearch instance is recommended for development and test but not for production.
For production it is recommended to run a standalone Elasticsearch cluster (please refer to Elasticsearch official documentation for more details).
In order to use a standalone Elasticsearch cluster, the following properties must be defined in exo.properties:
* exo.es.embedded.enabled=false - Disable the default Embedded Elasticsearch
* exo.es.index.server.url=<indexing_URL> - URL of the node used for indexing
* exo.es.search.server.url=<searching_URL> - URL of the node used for searching

For advanced configuration and more details please refer to the eXo Platform documentation.

=== Unified search ===

*  Data must be reindexed in order to apply the fix INTEG-458 for existing contents.
